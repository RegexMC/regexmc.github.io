### Self Hosting
It is possible to self host, but it would be annoying to set up due to the folder structure I'm using and some resources it accesses aren't on the repo, so you would have to figure these out. Until the time comes when I feel this bot is in a state where I can make it public, I won't make any effort to make it easier for users to self host. If there are any commands from it you want- just make your own bot to suit your own needs and copy paste the code over.
